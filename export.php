 * Refactor this code to be the tidiest, 'best practice' design you can come up with
 * The point of this exercise is not to find minor bugs in the code, but to focus on the architecture of 
 * this piece of software and ensure it is very well designed - easy to maintain, extend, refactor over 
 * time as required.
 * 
 * This code uses a standalone implementation of Laravel Collections which provides the global 'collect'
 * method and various methods which operate on the resulting Collection object.
